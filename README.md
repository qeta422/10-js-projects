# 10-js-projects using HTML, CSS and JS

## Let's build 10 simple projects using basic HTML structure, simple CSS flex styles and Javascript functions.

  This project is a very good example of how we can build simple but secessary web applications using 
HTML semantic element structure, some basic CSS styles and entry-level JavaScript knowledge. 
The project will help one to better understand javaScript logic and apply this experience to many individual projects.

* Use HTML structure to display the content you want
* Make the content more aesthetically noticeable with basic CSS styles
* Position your content with CSS Flexbox properties
* Use HTML id-s to select desired elements in JavaScript
* Create functions and write logics
* Add Element EventListeners to assign your functions to buttons (Note: some function names will be inserted directly in html files without asigning)
